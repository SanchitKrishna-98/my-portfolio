        About Me
      </h2>
      <p>
      Hi there! I’m a Computer Science graduate from the University at Buffalo, with a passion for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, teaching machines to think while I survive off coffee and curiosity. I love bringing AI/ML to life through full-stack development, crafting solutions that are not only smart and scalable, but make people say, “Wow, that’s actually useful!”
      </p>
      <p>
      With over three years of hands-on experience in software development, I’ve navigated the trenches of the SDLC and danced through Agile sprints. I specialize in building responsive frontends with Vue.js and React, and developing robust backend systems using Python and Java. Some highlights? Helping build precision agriculture tools at Trimble (yes, the one that was part of a $2B AGCO deal), and developing smart dashboards at Payoda for prominent telecom giants.

      <p>
      Tech is my playground—and I’m just getting started.
