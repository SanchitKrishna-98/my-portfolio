      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a recent Computer Science graduate from the University at Buffalo, with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning—essentially teaching machines to think while fueling myself with coffee and curiosity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the past three years, I’ve worked across the full software development lifecycle, from building intuitive frontends with Vue.js and React, to developing scalable backends in Python and Java, often deploying them via AWS and CI/CD pipelines. I enjoy blending AI/ML with full-stack development to create solutions that are not only fast and efficient but genuinely useful.
      </p>
      <p>
        My journey has taken me through precision agriculture at Trimble, where I contributed to a path planning system that became part of a $2B AGCO acquisition, and into the telecom space at Payoda, where I built real-time sentiment dashboards for support teams.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether it’s streamlining operations, visualizing complex data, or turning abstract models into deployable products—tech is my playground, and I’m just getting started.
