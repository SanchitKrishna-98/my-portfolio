        About Me
      </h2>
      <p>
      I'm a Computer Science grad student at the University at Buffalo, specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning—basically, teaching machines to think while I survive off coffee and curiosity. I love blending AI/ML with full-stack development to build solutions that are not just fast and efficient, but also make you say, “Wow, that’s actually useful!”
      </p>
      <p>
      With over three years of experience in software development, I’ve worked through the trenches of the SDLC and danced to the rhythm of Agile sprints. From crafting sleek UIs with Vue.js and React to wrangling backend beasts in Python and Java, I’ve done a bit of everything. My adventures include helping build precision agriculture tools at Trimble (Yep, that’s the same project that ended up in a $2 billion AGCO deal) and rolling out smart dashboards at Payoda for telecom giants like Verizon and T-Mobile.

      Tech is my playground—and I’m just getting started.
